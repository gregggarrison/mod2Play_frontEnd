Job Finder APP

Job finder allows you to search jobs.github.com by location.  

Users can browse jobs georgraphically and save jobs to their favorites.

Each job (card) has the title of the position, location, and company logo on the front. 

Once clicked the card flips over showing the company name, link to directly apply, and a "Save to Favorites" button.

From there the user can view all saved favorites on a show page with pedigree info on the job as well as a link to hiring company's website

User can click "go home" to view all the jobs available... then rinse and repeat!

Future improvements:
    - More search capability (ie search by title, description, and location)
    - User login / profile page
    - Option to delete favorites
    - UPGRADED AESTHETICS
